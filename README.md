# HeartDiseasePrediction

A Simple ML Project."Logistic Regression" is used to train the model to predict whether a person is diagnosed with heart disease or not. A Dataset called 'heart_disease_data.csv' is used here which is taken from Kaggle.  

<h1>Overview:</h1>
This repository contains a simple project that predicts heart disease using machine learning techniques. The model employs a dataset from Kaggle, which comprises various medical and demographic attributes.Logistic Regression is used to predict whether an individual has heart disease. The trained model is saved using pickle to enable future predictions without retraining.

<h1>Model Details:</h1>
The project levrages Logistic Regression for binary classification. Key steps include:
- Importing necessary libraries (numpy, pandas, sklearn), Loading and preparing the dataset, Splitting the data into training and testing sets, Training the Logistic Regression model, Evaluating the model performance and Saving the trained model with pickle.
